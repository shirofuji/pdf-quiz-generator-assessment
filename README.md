## Technologies Used

- Next.js
- Tailwind
- pdf-parse - for parsing PDF Contents.
- pdf-lib - for chunking the PDF for large file supports.
- openai - for question generation.

## Usage

1. Upload a PDF using the upload interface.
2. The script extracts text and parses it for questions.
3. Questions will appear below the upload area with clickable answers.
4. Correct answers will be highlighted green upon selection.

## Approach

- Used pdf-lib to extract pages from the original PDF document.
- Generated chunked versions of the PDF, default is 5 pages per chunk can be updated in the code.
- Each chunk is parsed into plain text via pdf-parse.
- Used a pre-generated prompt with the chunk text appended to generate a question per chunk.
- Loops over and over through all chunks available until a total of 5 questions are generated.
- Prompt is created with a pre-defined json format for the question, choices, and an answer key.
- Questions are returned to the front-end page to display and create an interactive quiz UI.
- Used `.env` file to store OpenAPI Credentials to ensure version control exclusion of sensitive data as well as possible support for multiple environments.

## Known Limitations

- Accuracy of question detection depends on PDF formatting
- Does not support OCR for scanned images
- Only works with English-language MCQ patterns for now
- PDFs that are too small may have repeating questions
